### Hi there :raised_hands:, I am Kellyn! 

- ⚡ Fun fact: My passion for decentralised finance in the last two years got me switching from an end user to now a builder. Slowly but surely, I will get there :muscle:.

- :soon: How I am getting there:

- :small_blue_diamond: Got myself enrolled into GA bootcamp at start of 2023. Ask me anything about my self-learning journey + the roller coaster journey I had at GA bootcamp (still reminiscing about the intense, fun-filled and priceless friendships made) + two of my favourite projects I had built during my time there:

- :small_blue_diamond: My virgin project of my life: I have experimented on working on a classic game, Connect 4, and endeavoured to add another special mode to it. This special mode involves creating a spaceship on top of the grids, and with any key press, the coloured piece will drop down to the next available slot. Try both game modes here: [Connect 4](https://4game.netlify.app/)

- :small_blue_diamond: I have created [massDJ](https://github.com/kellynwong/massDJ) as my final project, which was hugely inspired by me wanting to have my choice of songs whenever I vist a restaurant for meals (you know how some restaurants are always playing some songs on repeat, or simply, the vibes are just wrong for the occasion).

- :small_orange_diamond: I’m currently learning/working on a zillow clone project (millow) and an amazon clone project (dappazon) of which, both backends are stored on the blockchain.

- :small_orange_diamond: I hope to complete my learning of Blockchain, Solidity and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript in 3 months time (target 2 April 2024).

- :small_orange_diamond: Meanwhile I am open to internships, LFG!
