### Hi there :raised_hands:, I am Kellyn!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning/working on a zillow clone project of which, the backend is stored on the blockchain.

- ðŸŒ± I hope to complete my learning of Blockchain, Solidity and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript in 3 months time (2 April 2024). OPEN TO INTERNSHIPS NOW. lfg.

- :large_blue_circle::red_circle: My virgin project: I have experimented on working on a classic game, Connect 4, and endeavoured to add another special mode to it. This special mode involves creating a spaceship on top of the grids, and with any key press, the coloured piece will drop down to the next available slot. Try both game modes here: [Connect 4](https://4game.netlify.app/)

- :large_blue_circle::red_circle: I have created [massDJ](https://github.com/kellynwong/massDJ) as my final project with General Assembly. This was inspired by me wanting to have my choice of songs whenever I vist a restaurant for meals (you know how some restaurants are always playing some songs on repeat, or simply, the vibes are just wrong for the occasion).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about my self-learning journey + General Assembly bootcamp (intense, fun-filled and priceless friendships made), onwards to learning and building more meaningful and fun apps!

- âš¡ Fun fact: My passion for decentralised finance in the last two years got me switching from an end user to now a builder. Slowly but surely, I will get there :muscle:.
