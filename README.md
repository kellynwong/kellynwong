#### :star: About Me
I'm deeply fascinated by the potential of decentralized finance, a passion that sparked in 2021. With a bold leap into the unknown, I embarked on a journey from zero into tech. My milestone was completing a Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly in 2023. Here's a glimpse into some of the exciting projects I've worked on:

#### :rocket: My Projects

- **Connect 4 with a Twist**: My debut project revamps the classic Connect 4 game. I added a unique mode where players command a spaceship to drop colored pieces into play. Check out both classic and special modes [here](https://4game.netlify.app/).

- **massDJ**: Inspired by my love for music and a desire to personalize restaurant playlists, massDJ was born as my capstone project. It's a tool that lets users control the music vibe in eateries. Discover more about massDJ on [GitHub](https://github.com/kellynwong/massDJ).

#### :bulb: What I'm Doing Now

- **Web3 Development**: Currently, I'm solidifying my learnings (from the last few months) by building side projects using the full stack - Solidity, Ether.js, Web3.js, Hardhat, Node.js, which includes learning and writing tests.

- **Seeking Job Opportunities**: I'm on the lookout for job opportunities in Web3 development. I believe in learning by doing, and what better way than to be part of a dynamic team?
