### Hi there :raised_hands:, I am Kellyn!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [massDJ] (https://github.com/kellynwong/massDJ).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Blockchain, Solidity and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript.

- :large_blue_circle::red_circle: My virgin project: I have experimented on working on a classic game, Connect 4, and endeavoured to add another special mode to it. This special mode involves creating a spaceship on top of the grids, and with any key press, the coloured piece will drop down to the next available slot. Try both game modes here: [Connect 4] (https://4game.netlify.app/).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects which will allow me to deep dive and learn new languages and concepts.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about my self-learning journey + General Assembly bootcamp (intense, fun-filled and priceless friendships made), onwards to learning and building more meaningful and fun apps!

- âš¡ Fun fact: My passion for decentralised finance in the last two years got me switching from an end user to now a builder. Slowly but surely, I will get there :muscle:.
