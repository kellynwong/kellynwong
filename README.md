#### :star: About Me
I’m a Software Engineer at [Angu Labs](https://angulabs.com), where I work on developing full stack decentralized applications (dApps) and experimenting with new blockchain technologies. Since discovering decentralized finance in 2021, I’ve been fascinated with the potential of Web3. I completed a Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly in 2023 and have been steadily building my skills ever since. 

I am most interested in DeFi, DePIN, and the practical applications of ZK Proofs.

#### :rocket: What I'm Doing Now

- **Web3 Development**: I develop and prototype decentralized applications and have worked with several stealth projects to iterate on new narratives. I am most familiar on the frontend, but have been continually learning, using technologies like Solidity, Ether.js, Web3.js, and Node.js to ship product. 

- **Prototyping with Angu Labs**: If you’re interested in prototyping your blockchain project or exploring new ideas, feel free to reach out.
